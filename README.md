1. Connect your account to Vercel

    The first step to deploy this project in Vercel is createing a new account or use existing account. As a beginner programmer, I would prefer using GitHub account instead. 

    After you successfully login, you wil be redirected to dashboard of Vercel app like this:

    In thise case, I already import the project from GitHub to Vercel. So if you want to import your existing project from GitHub, you can "Add New Project" like this:
